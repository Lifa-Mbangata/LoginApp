The LoginApp is a simple Android application developed using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Room Database. It allows users to register by entering their email and password, which are then stored locally using Room. Users can log in using the same credentials, and the app checks for a match in the stored data to authenticate them. The app includes three main screens: a login screen, a registration screen, and a display screen that shows all registered users. Navigation between screens is handled using Jetpack Composeâ€™s NavController, and user data is managed through DAO methods like insertUser() and getUser() for efficient database interactions.
